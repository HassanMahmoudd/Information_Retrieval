- Introduction:
Information retrieval is finding material - usually documents - of an unstructured nature - usually text - that satisfies an information needed from within large collections. It tries to match these documents with the provided information in the query using different metrics, models and concepts. These methods vary and are evaluated according to the degree of relevancy of resulted documents to the query.
